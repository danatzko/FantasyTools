Analysis Plan

Problem:  Predict the players who will score the most points.  Of the top-scoring points, use the salaries of each player to maximize the points scored of a single entry.

Approach: 
 - Baseline scoring statistics
 - Standard deviation and how easily influenced?
 - Create a game model that summarizes defense and offense production with the purpose of identifying who performed above, below or within the standard deviation.
	- Each players, % of snaps played (game), % of snaps played (season)	
 - X-check penalties for/against both teams of each game and adjust averages/totals 
	Some yards are earned, and some yards arenâ€™t
 - X-Check weather for each game and adjust averages/totals 



Questions:
 - Head Coach, Offensive/Defensive coordinator for each game available?
 - Define Standard deviation. 
	Average including all games and then 

Unknowable:
 - Injuries
 - Coaching/Player changes


Objective:
 - Create a data extraction tool that queries the nflgame API for summarized and specific stats.
 - Create a Django App using the Data Access Layer (DAL) paradigm to properly model 

Functional Requirements:
 - Upload CSV for parsing and predictions
 - Update at scheduled intervals
 - Player Search w/ Metadata

Data 
Normalization 
- Identify missing ETL functionality
	- Reusable player search
	- Reusable player from games 
Pipeline Managment
- Use Luigi to setup ETL tasks and monitor
	- update for schedule and player 
	- summaries and totals
	- publish predictions

Machine Learning
 - Classify - establish a set of labels for a finite set of objects
 - Regression - predict a set of labels for an infinite set of objects
	contiguous target variable
 - Train (regression) - apply model to 
 - Test
 - Fit
 - Predict


PROBLEMS:
 - How to run nflgame (python 2.7) and Django (python 3.6) in the same app
 -
